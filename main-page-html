  <h1 id="about-section-header" class="main-page-section-header">About RampantLionReviews</h1>
 
    <p> RampantLionReviews was founded by me, James Marshall, in July 2013. 
    <br> 
    <p>I am a Software Developer by trade but am also a qualified Science & Maths teacher and graduated with Masters Degrees in Chemistry and Astrophysics.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>During my time at Aberdeen University, I had a German flatmate called Daniel. One evening we went to the famous Moorings Bar (now Krakatoa)
    to listen to some live metal and it was that night in 2009 that Daniel introduced me to Schlenkerla Rauchbier. Having never liked beer prior to this, 
    trying this Märzen proved to be somewhat of a revelation!</p>
    <br> 
    <p>This was also around the time that Brewdog began to pop up and they opened their bar next to Marischal college in 2010. Over the next two or three years
    I visited the bar regularly and always tried different styles of beer. I began to wonder “How could anyone possibly remember all the different beers that they’ve 
    tried?” and eventually I came up with the idea that I could make videos for YouTube to document all the beers that I tried myself.</p>
    <br> 
    <p> At the time I thought that I had a very unique idea but, after starting to make videos in July 2013, I soon found that there was already a small community of
    BeerTubers and over the years this has steadily grown to be a great global community. </p> 
    <br> 
    <p> I started RampantLionReviews as my own way of documenting the beers that I tried with the mentality that “If other people like it, great. 
    If they don’t, meh I’m having fun!”. It turned out that quite a lot of people did like it and the channel has grown to have over 20,000 subscribers.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>The channel has evolved to include different kinds of videos with beer from all over the world but there is still much to cover!</p>

  <h1 id="beer-explained-header"> What are the different types of beer?<h1>
    
    <p> This is in fact very simple. There are only two main types of beer: Lager and Ale.<p> 
    <br> 
    <p>All beer styles, such as stout or IPA, fit into one of these two categories.</p>
    <br> 
    <p>The key difference between a lager and ale is in the fermentation process:</p>
    <br>
      <ol> 
        <li>Lagers ferment using yeasts that operate at colder temperatures, known as bottom-fermenting yeasts.</li>
        <li>Ales ferment using yeasts that operate at higher temperatures, known as top-fermenting yeasts.</li>
      </ol>

   <h1>How to taste beer:</h1>
      <p>Over the years, I have developed my own way of tasting beer that has evolved.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Before going into more detail, some general statements can be made:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sweet flavours in the beer will come from the malts</li>
          <li>Bready and grainy flavours will come from a mixture of the malts and the yeast.</li>
          <li>Floral, grassy and fruity flavours come from the hops.</li>
         </ul>
       <br>
       <p>While these are, of course, general statements there are other factors that can play a role in the flavour of beer. 
       For example, barrel-ageing can add different elements of woody and spirit flavours to the beer. Many sour beers also contain different 
       fruits that will also contribute to the flavour.</p>
       <br>
       <p> All of these flavours can be found on different parts of the palate:</p>
       <br>
       <p> The sweet flavours from the malt will appear in the <span>middle third</span> of the palate and it will often be the case that the more bready or grainy 
       side of the malt will be underneath the sweeter caramelly or biscuity flavours which mask the alcohol.The bready side of the malty flavours continues into
       the <span>back third</span> of the palate and will show a more dry and grainy character. </p>
       <br> 
       <p>Often, yeasty flavours can be found on top of that and flavours such as a more light, airy and farmhouse bread can be enjoyed.</p> 
       <br> 
       <p>Hoppy flavours will be found on the <span>edges</span> and <span>front third</span> of the palate.The earthy, floral and grassy or “green” flavours that 
       contribute to the bitterness will be found on the edge of the palate. The oily fruity flavours from hops will be found on the front third of the palate.</p>
       <br>
       <p>In the case of beers containing adjuncts, the position of the flavour will very much depend on the adjunct itself. Coffee beans for example will be found
       further back on the palate due to their more bitter nature, whereas adjunct fruits will be detected further forward on the palate due to their sweetness and
       will often supress some of the bitterness from green side of the hops.</p>
       <br>
       <p>In the case of sour beers and wild ales there will often be a sour impact that will mellow out over the course of drinking the beer. 
       This can often be detected in the middle of the front third of the palate.</p>

 <div id="beer-ingredients" class="main-page-section">
 
 <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
 
  <h2>Water:</h2>
    <p>Water composes 90-95% of the average beer. Water profiles contain different minerals and ions and this will of course vary depending on the
    location of the individual brewery.</p>
    <br>
  <h2>Malt:</h2>
    <p>The malt base of a beer contributes the bready and sweet flavours to a beer. The vast majority of malt used in brewing is barley treated in different
    ways to create different kinds of malt such as black, chocolate, rauch, Crystal, Carafa etc. A number of more traditional beers styles contain a considerable
    portion of wheat malt, while a number of the more modern styles also contain some malted oat or rye.</p>
    <br>
  <h2>Hops:</h2>
    <p>Hops contribute the many of the fruity and “green” flavours (such as earthy, floral and grassy) to the beer. The traditional beer countries such as Belgium,
    Czech, England & Germany are all long-standing hop-producing nations. There are innumerable different varieties of hops with their own individual green and fruity
    characteristics. In the more recent Craft Beer years, nations such as the USA, New Zealand and Australia have also become large hop-producers.</p>
    <br>
  <h2>Yeast:</h2>
    <p>Yeast bacteria do the hardest job in brewing: converting sugar into alcohol. Bacteria evolve over generations and, in today’s brewing world, many brewers use
    yeast strains that are specific to the style of beer that they are brewing. Similarly, many older breweries have developed their own house yeast strains over tens
    and even hundreds of years. The length of the fermentation process can vary greatly and is again normally specific to the individual beer style or the brewer’s
    discretion.</p>
    <br>
  <h2>Adjuncts:</h2> 
    <p>Adjuncts are used as a more direct way to inject specific flavours into a beer that can be complementary to the style. Traditional Belgian beers have long used
    different sugars in their beers to add ABV to the beer. In modern craft brewing adjuncts can include a variety of different fruits which are common in sour/wild ales
    and coffee beans or flavour essence in imperial stouts to name but a few.</p>

 <div id="brewing-process" class="main-page-section">
 
  <h1>The Brewing Process:</h1>
  
    <p>Many have the misconception that the brewing process is extremely complicated, however it can be explained succinctly when split into three stages:</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>The malted grain is placed in the mash tun and warm water is pumped through the mix to extract the sugars. The resulting sugary liquid is known as the wort.</li>
      <li>The wort is then boiled and hops are added at different time junctures to give bitterness, flavour and aroma. At the end of the wort boil, the resulting mix of 
      wort and hops is then quickly cooled.</li>
      <li>The cool liquid is transferred to a fermentation vessel. At this point the yeast (and an adjuncts) is added to the raw beer to start the conversion of sugar
      to alcohol. The key variables in the fermentation are the individual yeast strain, temperature and the time - these variables are often style-specific.</li>
    </ol>
